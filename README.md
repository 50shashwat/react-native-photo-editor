# Note
**The difference between the 2 platforms is huge - Be careful when using**<br/>
This lib is for personal use, so if you customize your style or change something, Please fork this library and check the detailed documentation in the original library:

- [iOS](https://github.com/muukii/Brightroom)
- [Android](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor)

> During the development of this package. I was thinking of moving it as part of [an earlier library](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-multiple-image-picker) that I finished. If the support community for this library was large enough, I would have to dismiss this idea immediately.

We can download the neutral LUT image from [lutCreator.js](https://sirserch.github.io/lut-creator-js/#).
### [Hald Images](https://3dlutcreator.com/3d-lut-creator---materials-and-luts.html)
> Hald is a graphical representation of 3D LUT in a form of a color table which contains all of the color gradations of 3D LUT. If Hald is loaded into editing software and a color correction is applied to it, you can use 3D LUT Creator to convert your Hald into 3D LUT and apply it to a photo or a video in your editor.
