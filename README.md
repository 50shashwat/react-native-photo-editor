ðŸŒ„ Image editor using native modules for iOS and Android. Inherit from 2 available libraries, [Brightroom](https://github.com/muukii/Brightroom) (iOS) and [PhotoEditor](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor) (Android)

# Note
**The difference between the 2 platforms is huge - Be careful when using**
<br/>
This lib is for personal use, so if you customize your style or change something, Please fork this library and check the detailed documentation in the original library:

- [iOS](https://github.com/muukii/Brightroom)
- [Android](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor)

> During the development of this package. I was thinking of moving it as part of [an earlier library](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-multiple-image-picker) that I finished. If the support community for this library was large enough, I would have to dismiss this idea immediately.

## Feature ðŸ™ˆ

###  Both
- Draw (Support custom line color).
- Adding/Editing **Text** with option to change its Color.
- Adding **Images/Stickers**
- Pinch to Scale and Rotate views.

### iOS
- Apply Filter Effect on image using [LUT Color](#custom-filtersios) (Custom filter is simpler than android)
- Crop image.
### Android
- Drawing on image with option to change its Brush's Color, Size, Opacity, Erasing and basic shapes.
- Apply Filter Effect on image using [MediaEffect](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/effect/EffectFactory). But in the future will change to LUT color.

### Custom Filters(iOS)
#### LUT (Hald image)

[How to create cube data from LUT Image](https://www.notion.so/CoreImage-How-to-create-cube-data-from-LUT-Image-for-CIColorCube-CIColorCubeWithColorSpace-9e554fd418e8463abb25d6232613ac1c)

We can download the neutral LUT image from [lutCreator.js](https://sirserch.github.io/lut-creator-js/#).
#### [Hald Images](https://3dlutcreator.com/3d-lut-creator---materials-and-luts.html)
> Hald is a graphical representation of 3D LUT in a form of a color table which contains all of the color gradations of 3D LUT. If Hald is loaded into editing software and a color correction is applied to it, you can use 3D LUT Creator to convert your Hald into 3D LUT and apply it to a photo or a video in your editor.

[Detailed documentations are available on here](https://www.notion.so/Creating-your-own-filters-LUT-d1942f2f5bcc44d88481d0a0cc4aacb3#d7bba7a891234ea48f1854b5e555366a)

**IMPORTANT**
You have to create ```LUTs.bundle``` and add all your LUT Photo(Re-name your LUT Photo follow this format: [LUT_64_FILTER_NAME](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-photo-editor/tree/master/resources/LUTs.bundle)) into ```LUTs.bundle```. Then add ```LUTs.bundle``` into ```Copy Bundle Resources```. [See detail](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-photo-editor/tree/master/example/ios)

  ...
] 
```
### Local
